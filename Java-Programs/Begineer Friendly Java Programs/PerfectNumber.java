/*A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. 
Proper positive divisors are positive integers that fully divide the perfect number without leaving a remainder and exclude the perfect number itself.
For example, take the number 6: 
Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3 (since 6 is the value of the perfect number, it is excluded), and the sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 

Therefore, 6 is a perfect number (as well as the first perfect number).*/
